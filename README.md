# Futuristic 3D Experience

A modern, immersive, and interactive 3D experience built using [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), and [@react-three/postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-postprocessing). This project showcases a futuristic scene featuring a rotating spaceship, holographic elements, cinematic postprocessing effects, and real-time interactive controls via [Leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva).

## Features

- **Immersive 3D Scene**  
  Full-screen rendering of a dynamic scene with a rotating and floating spaceship model and floating holographic text.

- **Cinematic Effects**  
  Bloom and postprocessing effects add a dramatic, futuristic glow.

- **Interactive Controls**  
  Modify ambient light, rotation speed, bloom intensity, and more using Leva’s real-time control panel.

- **Dynamic Environment**  
  A starfield backdrop with animated elements to set the tone.

- **Optional Camera Animation**  
  Smooth automated camera movement for an immersive viewing experience.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stanleyMuiruri/first-3d-animation.git
   cd first-3d-animation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or with yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Install required packages (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei leva @react-three/postprocessing
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**  
   Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified in your environment) to explore the 3D experience.

3. **Interact with the scene:**
   - Use your mouse to rotate, zoom, and explore.
   - Use the Leva control panel to tweak scene parameters in real time.

## Customization

- **Model Replacement:**  
  Place your custom `.glb` or `.gltf` models in the `public/` folder and update the import paths in `Spaceship.jsx`.

- **Lighting & Effects:**  
  Tune the lighting or postprocessing settings in `Scene.jsx`.

- **User Controls:**  
  Modify control parameters in the Leva control panel to adjust scene properties.

- **Camera Animations:**  
  Edit `CameraPath.jsx` for custom motion paths or remove it to use manual camera control.
